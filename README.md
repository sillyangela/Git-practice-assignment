### Cool ideas of side projects

One of the most important ways to develop skills and improve employability as a software engineer is to work on side projects. These can run the gamut from open source projects to helpful tools and scripts, to fun toys. This website provides many interesting ideas of software projects for people to choose to implement and improve their own skills. It is fun to check out the excellent side project ideas and consider doing one.

### Example ideas:

* FTP Client (suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app).

  * Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.

* HTTP Server (suggested implementation: any programming language).

  * To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of tutorials available to guide through the process.

### Arushi's comment

I find lists like these helpful - people always say a side project should be something you'd find useful or that you want to have, but since software already exists out there for pretty much anything I'd want to do, and they've usually done it better than I can, I get very hung up on trying to figure out an idea. The ideas on this list vary in complexity from something that could take a few hours to full projects that could take many months (all depending on how developed you want it to be too), and achieve the main purpose of a side project - which is practice!


### William Cho's comment

This is a very comprehensive and useful article that will help me get started on my eventual side project. I think doing a side project is really helpful for further developing your skills and preparing for the professional world. A lot of these projects sound very interesting to partake in.
