<h2>Cool ideas of side projects

One of the most important ways to develop skills and improve employability as a software engineer is to work on side projects. These can run the gamut from open source projects to helpful tools and scripts, to fun toys. This website provides many interesting ideas of software projects for people to choose to implement and improve their own skills.
<h3>Example ideas:

* FTP Client (suggested implementation: web, desktop or CLI app).
 
  * Build a simple FTP client. As a bonus challenge, support secure file transfer.

* HTTP Server (suggested implementation: any programming language). 
  
  * To understand HTTP deeply, build an HTTP server. There are a number of tutorials available to guide through the process.
